# ShoppingWebsite_Project01
Hello friends...

In this Project I created the classes of a shopping site.


There are 4 products sold on the site and they are registered in the Database class.

On a shopping site

The customer registers on the site with his user information,
He chooses the product he wants to buy,
Determines the amount,
Throws it into the shopping cart,
completes the payment,
If he wants to continue shopping, it is possible for him to buy as much of the product as he wants...

I created the
Address,
Card,
CartItem,
Item,
User,
City,
Color 
classes and enums and the shopping site project ran smoothly.
